# Embark

An ambitious Vim theme.

![screenshot](embark-screenshot.png)

## Getting Started

> At this time only terminals supporting truecolors will work. Make sure you have `set termguicolors` in your vimrc

First install plugin with your favorite plugin manager.
```
Plug 'skbolton/embark'
```

Then set your colorsheme in vim.
```
colorscheme embark
```

### Lightline support

A lightline theme is also available. Just set your colorscheme to embark.

```
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'colorscheme': 'embark',
      \ }
```

### Airline support

Airline should just pick up on theme automatically, but if there is an issue with this it can be set manually.
`let g:airline_theme = 'embark'`

## Configuration

Embark offers a few configuration values to control features. Setting values to `1` will turn the feature on.

Italics - Make sure your terminal is set up to handle them. See [this](https://medium.com/@dubistkomisch/how-to-actually-get-italics-and-true-colour-to-work-in-iterm-tmux-vim-9ebe55ebc2be) for help getting italics and true color working in your terminal.

`let g:embark_terminal_italics = 1`
